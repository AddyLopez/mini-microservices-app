# mini-microservices-app

A mini microservices app, using React, Express, and NodeJS

## Learning Objectives

To gain a better conceptual and practical understanding of the advantages and complexities of microservices architecture. To build an application with microservices for two resources--posts and comments--then adding a query service and a comment moderation service. To build the architecture with an informed understanding of the tradeoffs of synchronous and asynchronous communication between services. To implement a basic event bus from scratch, which handles the emitting and processing of different events across microservices without introducing any direct dependencies. To gain experience handling updates to resources via communication with the event bus.
